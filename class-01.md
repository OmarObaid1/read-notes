# Html
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. ... The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format

---------------------------

HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1999

# Elements and Tags:
 HTML uses predefined tags and elements which tell the browser how to properly display the content. Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page

# HTML page structure:
 The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.
 ![HTML page structure](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210323163147/htmlstruct.PNG)

 ----------------------------------
 <DOCTYPE! html>: This is the document type declaration (not technically a tag). It declares a document as being an HTML document. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.
<html>: This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.
<head>: The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren’t visible on the front-end of a webpage. HTML elements used inside the <head> element include: 



<body>: the body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front-end.

An HTML document can be created using any text editor. Save the text file using .html or .htm. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.

NOTE: Basic/built-in text editors are Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (Macs). Basic text 

editors are entirely sufficient for when you’re just getting started. As you progress, there are many feature-rich text editors available which allow for greater function and 
flexibility.

# structure of html
### An HTML 4 document is composed of three parts: a line containing HTML version information, a declarative header section (delimited by the HEAD element), a body, which contains the document's actual content


## Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts: 

+ HEAD: This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta Data etc.
+ BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.

HTML for structuring content
The simple example shown above isn't pretty, but it is perfectly fine for illustrating a typical website layout example. Some websites have more columns, some are a lot more complex, but you get the idea. With the right CSS, you could use pretty much any elements to wrap around the different sections and get it looking how you wanted, but as discussed before, we need to respect semantics and use the right element for the right job.

This is because visuals don't tell the whole story. We use color and font size to draw sighted users' attention to the most useful parts of the content, like the navigation menu and related links, but what about visually impaired people for example, who might not find concepts like "pink" and "large font" very useful?

# How Pages Use Structure
The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also
feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside
the corresponding article on its website

# Structuring Word Documents
This might be expanded upon
under subheadings lower down
on the page. When using a word
processor to create a document,
we separate out the text to give
it structure. Each topic might
have a new paragraph, and each
section can have a heading to
describe what it covers.
On the right, you can see a
simple document in Microsoft
Word. The different styles for
the document, such as different
levels of heading, are shown
in the drop down box. If you
regularly use Word, you might
have also used the formatting
toolbar or palette to do this.

# Extra Markup
## what is the extra markup in html?

The -meta- element lives inside the <-head-> element and contains information about the web page It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page, who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive The meta element is an empty element.

### The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE , is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document. The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers



![inline elements](https://slidetodoc.com/presentation_image_h/33d2e216a76d971114a8198a41d5b5fb/image-6.jpg)

Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line. An anchor (or link) is an example of an inline element. You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a line
