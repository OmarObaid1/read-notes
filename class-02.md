## Bold & Italic
+ The <b> element also represents
a section of text that would be
presented in a visually different
way (for example key words in a
paragraph) although the use of
the <b> element does not imply
any additional meaning.

+ The <i> element also represents
a section of text that would be
said in a different way from
surrounding content — such as
technical terms, names of ships,
foreign words, thoughts, or other
terms that would usually be
italicized.

# what is  html text?

### HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the way web pages and email templates are coded so that text is formatted and images are added. Plain Text is regular text, with no formatting options such as bold, italics, underlines, or special layout options


# how do you see html text?

You can show HTML tags as plain text in HTML on a website or webpage by replacing < with -&lt-;- or &60; and > with -&gt-; or &62; on each HTML tag that you want to be visible. Ordinarily, HTML tags are not visible to the reader on the browser.

# Introducing CSS
CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.
In this example, block level
elements are shown with red
borders, and inline elements
have green borders.
The <-body-> element creates the
first box, then the <-h1->, <-h2->,
<-p->, <-i->, and <-a-> elements each
create their own boxes within it.
Using CSS, you could add a
border around any of the boxes,
specify its width and height, or
add a background color. You
could also control text inside
a box — for example, its color,
size, and the typeface used.

# CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed

The main methods of achieving page layout in CSS are all values of the display property. This property allows us to change the default way something displays. Everything in normal flow has a value of display , used as the default way that elements they are set on behave.

# What are display properties in CSS?

The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex. Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer display types.
