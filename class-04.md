# What is HTML link?
HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document. ... Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element

# HTML Links:
## How do you make a link in HTML?
To make a hyperlink in an HTML page, use the <-a-> and <-/a> tags, which are the tags used to define the links. The <-a-> tag indicates where the hyperlink starts and the <-/a> tag indicates where it ends. Whatever text gets added inside these tags, will work as a hyperlink. Add the URL for the link in the <-a href=” ”>

# Why Users & Search Engines need HTML Link Tags?
External hyperlinks to other sites (also known as “outbound links”) provide added value to users because they refer users to information and services that are relevant

# What is the purpose of using a HTML link?
What does HTML Link Options Illustrated With Code Examples do? The <link> element is used to define a relationship between an HTML document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to define the relationship between a document and one or more external CSS stylesheets.

# Key Concepts in layout css

## Building Blocks

### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. 
This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use
borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

# Block-level elements
## start on a new line

### Examples include:

<-h1-> <-p-> <-ul-> <-li->





# Inline elements
## flow in between surrounding text
### Examples include:
<-img> <-b> <-i>

# Floating Elements:
Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box. The floated element becomes a block-level
element around which other content can flow.

# Fixed Positioning
This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions
the element in relation to the
browser window, as opposed
to the containing element.
Elements with fixed positioning
do not affect the position of
surrounding elements and they
do not move when the user
scrolls up or down the page 


![fixed](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/css-position-160302074934/95/css-position-6-638.jpg?cb=1456905038)


# Relative Positioning position:
Relative positioning moves an
element in relation to where it
would have been in normal flow.
For example, you can move it 10
pixels lower than it would have
been in normal flow or 20% to
the right.
You can indicate that an element
should be relatively positioned
using the position property
with a value of relative.

--------------------------------
# Normal Flow position static
n normal flow, each block-level
element sits on top of the next
one. Since this is the default
way in which browsers treat
HTML elements, you do not
need a CSS property to indicate
that elements should appear
in normal flow, but the syntax
would be The paragraphs are restricted
to 450 pixels wide. This shows
how the elements in normal flow
start on a new line even if they
do not take up the full width of
the browser window

---------------------------
# Absolute:-
An html element will be positioned with respect to its parent. Positioning of this element does not depend upon its siblings or the elements which are at same level.


![](https://miro.medium.com/max/342/1*CCSZdDPbAm-hQ2H2mE_JAA.png)



-------------------------------

# Fixed:-
Any HTML element property will be positioned relative to the viewport. An element with fixed positioning allows it to remain at the same position even we scroll the page. We can set the position of the element using the top, right, bottom, left


![](https://miro.medium.com/max/386/1*xth_nTAvezFqS0zuLlGBWA.png)






# Sticky:-
The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor.

# Box Model
HTML page is a collection of HTML elements . Each element is considered as a box. Each box has four layers.
1. First layer is a content layer. Content can be text or image.
1. Around content layer, padding layer is applied.
1. Around padding layer, border layer is applied.
1. Around border layer, margin layer is applied

# Fixed Width Layouts
Fixed layouts are layouts that start with a specific size as stipulated by the web designer. They remain that width, regardless of the size of the browser window viewing the page. Fixed-width layouts allow a designer more direct control over how the page will look in most situations.

# Liquid Layouts
Liquid Layout is a general term that covers a set of specific liquid page rules: scale, re-center, guide-based, and object-based page rules. Use Liquid page rules to adapt content for output sizes. To adapt layouts when creating new pages in the same document using alternate layouts

# What are objects and methods in JavaScript?
Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions. An object method is an object property containing a function definition. JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties and methods.

# What is the difference between object and method in JavaScript?

In the nutshell, Object in JavaScript is just key-value pairs stored in a Hash. The difference between property and method is that -- property is a value stored in the hash key, whereas method is a function stored in hash key. In this code sample. ... sayHello is the method of object, and it is a function








# What is the function of an object?
In computer programming, a function object is a construct allowing an object to be invoked or called as if it were an ordinary function, usually with the same syntax (a function parameter that can also be a function). Function objects are often called functors

# 6 resones for pair programming

# Why we should use pair programming?
Pair programming is an important technique for developing higher quality code, faster while also reducing risk and spreading knowledge in an organization. With pair programming, two software developers work on one computer, collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code, or test


# What is the goal of pair programming in extreme programming?
Pair programming is an Agile technique originating from Extreme programming (XP) in which two developers team together and work on one computer. The two people work together to design, code and test user stories. Ideally, the two people would be equally skilled and would each have equal time at the keyboard


# What makes a good pair programmer?
It is a very collaborative way of working and involves a lot of communication. While a pair of developers work on a task together, they do not only write code, they also plan and discuss their work. They clarify ideas on the way, discuss approaches and come to better solutions

# What are challenges in pair programming?
## Challenges & common pitfalls
+ Pair-programming is NOT the right tool for every task. ...
+ Pair-programming is NOT right for everyone. 

+ Remote pair-programming. ...
+ Lack of engagement. ...
+ Silence. ...
+ “Watch the Master” ...
+ Loss of Confidence. ...
+ Lack of code-ownership.
