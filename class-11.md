# Controlling sizes of images in C
You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.
Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.
You might think that your site
is likely to have images of all
different sizes, but a lot of sites
use the same sized image across
many of their pages.

# AligNing images Using C
In the last chapter, you saw how
the float property can be used
to move an element to the left or
the right of its containing block,
allowing text to flow around it.
Rather than using the <-img>
element's align attribute, web
page authors are increasingly
using the float property to align
images. There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved:
1. The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image
(such as the small class in our
example).
2. New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.
In this example you can see the
align-left and align-right
classes used to align the image.
It is also common to add a
margin to the image to ensure
that the text does not touch their
edges

# Centering images Using C
By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.
Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:
1: On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
2: On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.
You can specify class names
that allow any element to be
centered, in the same way that
you can for the dimensions or
alignment of images

# Background Images background-image
The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.
The path to the image follows
the letters url, and it is put
inside parentheses and quotes.
 Here is the image
 tile used in this
 example.
In the first example, you can
see a background image being
applied to an entire page
(because the CSS selector
applies to the <-body> element).
In the second example, the
background image just applies to
a paragraph.
If you search online, you will
find lots of resources that offer
background textures that you
can use on your pages

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
1. The Basics
Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.
At the heart of SEO is the idea of
working out which terms people
are likely to enter into a search
engine to find your site and then
using these terms in the right
places on your site to increase
the chances that search engines
will show a link to your site in
their results.
In order to determine who comes
first in the search results, search
engines do not only look at what
appears on your site. They also
consider how many sites link
to you (and how relevant those
links are). For this reason, SEO
is often split into two areas:
on-page techniques and off-page
techniques.

2. On-Page Techniques
On-page techniques are the
methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their
rating in search engines.
The main component of this is
looking at keywords that people
are likely to enter into a search
engine if they wanted to find
your site, and then including
these in the text and HTML code
for your site in order to help the
search engines know that your
site covers these topics.
Search engines rely very heavily
on the text that is in your pages
so it is important that the terms
people are going to search for
are in text. There are seven
essential places where you want
your keywords to appear.
Ensuring that any images have
appropriate text in the value of
their alt attribute also helps
search engines understand the
content of images.

3. Off-Page Techniques
Getting other sites to link to you
is just as important as on-page
techniques. Search engines help
determine how to rank your
site by looking at the number of
other sites that link to yours.
They are particularly interested
in sites whose content is related
to yours. For example, if you
were running a website that
sold fish bait, then a link from
a hairdresser is not likely to be
considered as relevant as one
from an angling community.
Search engines also look at the
words between the opening
<-a> tag and closing <-/a> tag
in the link. If the text in the link
contains keywords (rather than
just click here or your website
address) it may be considered
more relevant.
The words that appear in links to
your site should also appear in
the text of the page that the site
links to.


## On-Page S
1. Page Title
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the <-title> element which lives
inside the <-head> element.
2. URL / Web Address
The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.
3. Headings
If the keywords are in a heading
<-hn> element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.
4. Text
Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.


# How Many People Are Coming to Your Site?
+ Visits
This is the number of times
people have come to your site. If
someone is inactive on your site
for 30 minutes and then looks at
another page on your site, it will
be counted as a new visit.


+ Unique Visits
This is the total number of
people who have visited your site
over the specified period. The
number of unique visits will be
lower than the number of visits
if people have been returning to
your site more than once in the
defined period.


+ Page Views
The total number of pages all
visitors have viewed on your site.

+ Pages per Visit
The average number of pages
each visitor has looked at on
your site per visit.


+ Average Time on Site
The average amount of time
each user has spent on the site
per visit.
Date Se 


+ Date Selector
Using the date selector in the top
right hand corner of the site, you
can change the period of time
the reports display. When you
log in, this is usually set to the
last month, but you can change
it to report on a specific time
period.


+ Export
The export link just above the
title that says "visitors overview"
allows you to export the
statistics on this page for other
applications such as Excel.

# What Are Your Visitors Looking At?
1. Pages
This tells you which pages your
visitors are looking at the most
and also which pages they are
spending the most time on.

2. Landing Pages
These are the pages that people
arrive on when first visiting your
site. This can be particularly
helpful because you may find
people are not always coming
into your site via the homepage.

3. Top Exit Pages
This shows which pages people
most commonly leave from. If
a lot of people are leaving from
the same page then you might
consider changing that page or
improving it

4. Bounce Rate
This shows the number of people
who left on the same page that
they arrived on. A high bounce
rate suggests that the content is
not what they were looking for or
that the page did not sufficiently
encourage them to look around
the rest of the site. What counts
as a bounce
